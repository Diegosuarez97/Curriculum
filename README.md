Name: Juan Diego Suárez Pérez
Education: Student of Video Game Design and Development

--- Project Description
This project showcases my professional profile, skills, education, work experience, and personal projects. The sidebar is designed to immediately highlight my skills in design software and programming languages. The overall structure of the content is organized into the following areas:

1) Professional Profile: Includes my name and a brief introduction about me.

2) Academic Background: Displays my educational background, highlighting studies that contribute to my competencies in programming and design.

3) Work Experience: Features relevant work experience in the industry, as well as experience in other sectors that add transferable skills to my professional abilities.

4) Personal Projects: A gallery of illustrations, with plans to also include game demos, animations, and code samples that demonstrate my work and creativity.

Finally, the footer contains essential contact information, including residence, phone number, email, and professional social media links.

--- Information Architecture

The site’s design follows a traditional left-to-right reading flow. The left sidebar, labeled “Skills”, provides an overview of my skills in design software, programming languages, and language abilities, and it remains fixed for constant visibility. The page starts with the profile header displaying my name, studies, and professional profile. This is followed by the main content body, organized into labeled sections: Academic Background, Work Experience, and Personal Projects.

In the footer, you’ll find contact information and social media links, making it easy for potential collaborators or employers to connect.

--- Visual Design

The visual design draws inspiration from my personal logo and brand colors: gray and violet. Gray adds a sense of neutrality and readability, while violet highlights titles and conveys a sense of exclusivity and elegance. White serves as a contrasting tone that unifies both colors, offering a clear and professional aesthetic.

Icons and graphics on the site have rounded edges to soften the design and break away from rigid, square elements, creating a more dynamic look. Additionally, hover animations have been added to the sidebar, which will eventually link to secondary pages showcasing specific projects associated with each highlighted program or language.

The site’s structure is optimized for a logical reading flow from left to right and top to bottom, ensuring a smooth and intuitive user experience.
